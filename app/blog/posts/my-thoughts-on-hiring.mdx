This document is mostly related to engineering hiring, as I haven’t been involved in hiring for other functions. But I’d like to imagine that a lot of these concepts stay true, even if some of them are less applicable.

# Hiring is the most valuable thing a default alive company can do right

Once a company is [default alive](https://paulgraham.com/aord.html) (profitable or hand-wavably profitable), we still need to consider the 3mo, 6mo timelines for the company, but we can also begin to consider the 2y / 3y timelines for the company.

On a 30 month timeline, the highest impact company function is not engineering, sales, or marketing. It’s recruiting.

It should be obvious, but if you spend 100 hours to close a candidate that is as good or better than the average of your team, you’ve spent 100 hours to add 2000 hours of capacity to the team in the *next 12 months alone*. Candidates are also likely to know other candidates of a similar competency, and gives more team capacity to dedicate to hiring, which can cascade into further hires.

Let’s say we double our team size over the course of a year. The next year, 50% of the team is 

## Hire fast, fire fast

## On the EV (Expected Value) of new hires

A hire is not necessarily an increase in capacity. A poor hire can increase thrash, need frequent input and redirection, and leave open threads that take far longer to track down and iron out than it would ever have taken to do it right in the first place.

## Quality of close-able hires is power law distributed.

Wherever we set the hiring bar is going to be quality of most of our employees. As we raise the hiring bar, we’re also substantially decreasing the folks we have available to pick from.

No value judgement here, but it’s important to understand this dynamic.

## The hiring bar is ‘sticky’

Each person we hire gives us substantial access to hiring the people in their network. Hires believe

## Making “Autonomously Effective” hires

I think what we and nearly every other startup is looking to hire for are teammates that are “autonomously effective”.

This means they…

- Can reliably drive projects to completion.
- Get shit done at a reasonable pace
- Don’t substantially tax the rest of the team’s time / aren’t constantly blocked requiring input from others.

## The impact of a hire

### All hires incur the following cost

- Communication overhead
- Harder to maintain team-wide expectations and standards

Hires can be negative EV because they tax teammates (sorry about the MLLP server PR raf!)

## Belief drives success

Incredible hires by definition are those that excite and inspire the team. These kinds of hires…

- signal to the team that our co. is only getting stronger. They give the impression that ‘the rocket ship is taking off’.
- bring something new to the table to share with the team (this could be some kind of knowledge, or it could just be exciting energy and passion!)
-

## What is a “good enough” hiring bar?

I’m not sure. I think that there is almost always a bias towards setting the bar too low though, as…

- Saying no to people you like and seem decent is hard
- Saying no to people that are ‘almost there’ or ‘just barely there’ is hard
- It feels weird to dedicate 100 hours to hiring a single candidate. You feel like you’re not making progress.
