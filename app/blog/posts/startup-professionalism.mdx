It's no myth that startups are environments where mistakes are tolerated, and priorities are to (1) ship value to customers, and (2) find more customers.

But in the rush to ship, close deals fast, and prioritize ruthlessly, we tend to tolerate lots of whimsy 
and silliness that wouldn't be tolerated elsewhere. And while we _should_ bring our whimsicality to work, it's also up to us to be _professional_.

I don't think it means wearing a suit to work. Or being buttoned up.
